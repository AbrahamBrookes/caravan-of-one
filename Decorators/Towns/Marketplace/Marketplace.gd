class_name Marketplace

# the Marketplace is a tile which is used to trade goods. It is a generic market stall that changes
# the type of good depending on the person who owns it. Generally a market stall will sell lower
# quality goods than a specialized permanent shop would, and often a marketplace deals in secondhand
# goods as opposed to artisanal products
